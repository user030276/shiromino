; index if the first one detected isn't what you want. A joystick name will be
; used first, then the joystick index if the name wasn't found, if both are set
; here. There's no default settings for JOYNAME and JOYINDEX, so if neither are

; FRAMEDELAY sets how long the delay between drawing frames should be when not
; using vsync, in milliseconds. For "good enough" behavior that balances
; between low CPU usage and responsiveness, it's best to set it to something
; close to your monitor's refresh rate, though you can set it high enough to
; make the game run at a reduced frame rate with more lag, and reduced CPU
; usage. For 60Hz, 16 or 17 is suggested, assuming the game's gameplay and
; graphics aren't taking much time on your system. Setting it to 0 will
; basically disable the delay between drawing frames, increasing CPU usage
; significantly (it basically takes up 100% CPU usage of one core), but has
; less lag and more consistent and accurate game frame timing.

; If this option is set to 1, and vsync is enabled, the game will update one
; frame per rendered frame; this has the effect that all modes will run at the
; Hz setting of your monitor. If you can set your display's refresh rate to
; perfectly match that of a mode's, then this setting will ensure behavior much
; like the original games' hardware. Using this setting is strongly discouraged
; for setting records if your display's refresh rate differs from the mode
; you're trying to get records in. If you're not sure if you should use this
; setting, you almost certainly shouldn't. But, since it's common for
; exactly/nearly 60Hz to be supported by many systems, using this setting with
; the Pentomino modes, which all run at 60Hz, is probably fine.

; When set to 1, this option enables interpolated scaling, which improves

; The interpolation tries to keep the upscaled screen as close as possible to
; looking pixelated, rather than just blurry. Keep in mind that this does
; increase system requirements when enabled, and forces all graphics to use
; OpenGL, rather than the default SDL2 graphics API for your platform, which
; would be DirectX on Windows.
